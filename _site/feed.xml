Capsules, or swept spheres, are a powerful option to use as a bounding volume because of how little data is required to define them and how useful they are for collision detection. Imagine taking a sphere and sweeping it along a single line in space; the shape of this would be a capsule. We can define a capsule then as:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Vector3 start;
Vector3 end;
float radius;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These techniques can be used on any sort of point cloud, but let’s state the specifics of our case. We have a set of vertices that define some bone (right forearm, left leg, hip, etc.) and we want to find a capsule that best fits them. We’ll show how to do this generically and then how to adapt it to use Unity components.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Creating some sort of bounding volume for a set of vertices is a common problem in simulations and games.
