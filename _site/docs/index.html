        <br />
        <p>Creating some sort of bounding volume for a set of vertices is a common problem in simulations and games. Capsules, or swept spheres, are a powerful option to use as a bounding volume because of how little data is required to define them and how useful they are for collision detection. Imagine taking a sphere and sweeping it along a single line in space; the shape of this would be a capsule. We can define a capsule then as:</p>
